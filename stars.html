            <div class="text-container" id="mainseq">
                <p>Main sequence stars are stars in the longest, most stable phase of their life cycle. During this phase, they fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, releasing energy that provides light and heat. The Sun is an example of a main sequence star.</p>
            
                <div class="section-info">
                    <p><strong>Formation:</strong> Main sequence stars form from clouds of gas and dust that collapse under gravity. As the core temperature rises, nuclear fusion begins, creating a balance between gravity pulling inward and pressure pushing outward.</p> <br>
                    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Main sequence stars vary widely in size, temperature, and brightness. They are classified by spectral types (O, B, A, F, G, K, M), with O-type stars being the hottest and most massive, and M-type stars the coolest and smallest.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="text-container" id="giant">
                <p>Giant stars represent a later stage of stellar evolution that occurs after a main sequence star exhausts its core hydrogen. They are highly luminous and have greatly expanded outer layers.</p>
            
                <div class="section-info">
                    <p><strong>Formation:</strong> When a main sequence star uses up its core hydrogen, fusion stops in the core, and gravity causes it to contract and heat up. This triggers hydrogen fusion in an outer shell, causing the starâ€™s outer layers to expand and cool, forming a giant.</p> <br>
                    <p><strong>Types of Giants:</strong> Giants are classified into red giants, blue giants, and supergiants. Red giants are cooler and larger, while blue giants are hotter. Supergiants, like Betelgeuse, are massive stars that can evolve into supernovae.</p>

            <div class="text-container" id="white">
                <p>White dwarfs are the remnants of stars like the Sun after they have exhausted their nuclear fuel. They no longer undergo fusion and are extremely dense, gradually cooling over time.</p>
            
                <div class="section-info">
                    <p><strong>Formation:</strong> When a low-to-medium mass star (up to about 8 times the mass of the Sun) exhausts its nuclear fuel, it sheds its outer layers, leaving behind a hot, dense core. This core becomes a white dwarf.</p> <br>
                    <p><strong>End State:</strong> Eventually, a white dwarf will cool into a "black dwarf," though the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to have formed yet.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="text-container" id="neutron">
                <p>Neutron stars are incredibly dense stellar remnants formed from the collapsed core of a massive star following a supernova explosion.</p>
            
                <div class="section-info">
                    <p><strong>Formation:</strong> When a massive star (greater than 8 times the Sun's mass) undergoes a supernova, its core collapses under gravity, causing protons and electrons to combine into neutrons. This creates a neutron star, an object of immense density.</p> <br>
                    <p><strong>Types:</strong> Some neutron stars are observed as pulsars or magnetars if their magnetic poles and radiation beams are aligned with Earth, these also relate to gamma ray bursts. Neutron stars can also merge in binary systems, potentially forming black holes or emitting gravitational waves.</p>
