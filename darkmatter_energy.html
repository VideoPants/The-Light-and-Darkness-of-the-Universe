                    <p>The concepts of dark matter and dark energy were born from observations in astronomy and cosmology that traditional physics could not explain. In the 1930s, astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that galaxies in clusters were moving in ways that couldn't be accounted for by visible matter alone; he proposed the existence of “dark matter” – an invisible substance that provides additional gravitational pull. Later, in the 1970s, Vera Rubin’s work with galaxy rotation curves showed that the outer regions of galaxies moved faster than expected, reinforcing the idea of unseen mass within galaxies.</p>

                    <p>This section dives into the hidden forces that shape our universe. Dark matter and dark energy together account for over 95% of the universe, yet they remain invisible and undetectable by conventional means. Only through their effects on light and matter can we infer their existence. In this context, dark matter is a mysterious substance that forms a "cosmic scaffold," holding galaxies together with its gravitational influence, while dark energy is a force pushing the universe's expansion at an accelerating rate. Together, they form what can be described as the hidden architecture of the cosmos.</p>

                    <p>Anomalies in dark matter and dark energy reveal hidden forces shaping the cosmos. Gravitational lensing shows light bending around galaxy clusters more than visible mass alone can explain, suggesting unseen dark matter. Similarly, galaxy rotation curves reveal stars at the edges of galaxies moving as fast as those near the center, hinting at a "halo" of dark matter surrounding them. Meanwhile, the universe’s accelerating expansion, driven by dark energy, suggests a mysterious force pushing galaxies apart. Finally, the cosmological constant problem—where space's theoretical energy density doesn’t match observed values—indicates a profound gap in our understanding of dark energy.</p>
